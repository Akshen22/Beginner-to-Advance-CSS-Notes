1) Background Color:
We can add a background color to an HTML element using the background-color property.
Color can be specified using color names, HEX values, or RGB values.

body {
  background-color: teal;
}
p {
  background-color: #f0fdfa;
  padding: 20px;
}

2) Background Image:
An image can be added to the background of any element using the background-image property.

HTML:
<h1>
  Monsoon
</h1>
<p>
  A monsoon is traditionally a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation, but is now used to describe seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation associated with the asymmetric heating of land and sea.
</p>

CSS:
body {
  background-image: url('https://images.pexels.com/photos/4913167/pexels-photo-4913167.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=600');
  padding: 30px;
  color: white;
}

*In the above example, we used a large image. But if the image is smaller than the size of the element, the image repeats itself to cover the entire space*

3) Background Repeat:
By default, the background image repeats itself horizontally and vertically, if it's smaller than the element. This can be changed using the background-repeat property.

a) When this property is set to no-repeat, the image does not repeat itself:

body {
  padding: 60px;
  background-image: url('https://images.pexels.com/photos/2512387/pexels-photo-2512387.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=150');
  /* Image will not repeat */
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

b) When the property is set to repeat-x, it repeats itself only in the horizontal direction:

c) When the property is set to repeat-y, it repeats itself only in the vertical direction:

d) background-repeat: repeat (will repeat)

4) Background Size:

a) The background image for any element retains its original size. To adjust the image size, we need to use the background-size property.
When this property is set to cover, the image stretches or scales down in size to fill the entire container:

div {
  padding: 60px;
  background-image: url('https://images.pexels.com/photos/2512387/pexels-photo-2512387.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=400');
  /* Image stretches to occupy full space */
    background-size: cover;
}

b) The image stretches its width and height proportionately to fill up the entire space. If you resize the window, you can see that the image is either cropped at the bottom or at the right.
If instead, we want the image to be fully visible, the background size property can be set to contain:

div {
  padding: 60px;
  background-image: url('https://images.pexels.com/photos/2512387/pexels-photo-2512387.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=200');

  /* Stretches as much as possible
  but shows full image */
  background-size: contain;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
