8) nth Child:

a) Apart from the first and last child, you can also select a specific child element using the :nth-child pseudo-class!
HTML:
<ul>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Services</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>

CSS:
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0 0 40px -40px;
}
ul > li {
  display: inline-block;
  padding-right: 20px;
}
li:nth-child(2) {
  color: orange;
}

The child count starts from 1. Hence :nth-child(1) is same as :first-child.

b) Using the nth-child pseudo-class, you can also select even or odd numbered child elements!
HTML:
<h2>Planets of the Solar System</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mercury</li>
  <li>Venus</li>
  <li>Earth</li>
  <li>Mars</li>
  <li>Jupiter</li>
  <li>Saturn</li>
  <li>Uranus</li>
  <li>Neptune</li>
</ul>

CSS:
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin-left: -40px;
}
li {
  padding: 10px;
}
li:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #f0f1f6;
}

c) More types:
:nth-child(n+3) - Selects all matching child elements starting from 3rd one 
:nth-child(3n) - Selects every 3rd matching child element 
:nth-child(3n-2) - Selects every 3rd matching child element starting from the first one

/*Here, it's restricted to parent-child, to sort this issue, we can use: nth-of-type*/

9) nth-of-type:
a) When we want to select the 7th element of its type within its parent, or select the first 15 elements or every 3rd element and so on, 
We can use the :nth-of-type pseudo-class!

b) In the following example, we want to float every second link within the div to the right:
HTML:
<div>
  <p>
    Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time.
  </p>
  <a href="#">Works</a>
  <a href="#">Read more</a>
  <p>
    Sir Isaac Newton PRS was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author who is widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution.
  </p>
  <a href="#">Works</a>
  <a href="#">Read more</a>
</div>

c) CSS:
a:nth-of-type(even) {
  float: right;
}

d) Similarly, 
:nth-of-type(n+2) --> Selects all elements of the type starting from the 2nd one
:nth-of-type(3n) --> Selects every 3rd element of the type
:nth-of-type(3n-2) -->  Selects every 3rd element of the type starting from the first one

10) first-of-type:
With the :first-of-type pseudo-class, we can select a particular type of element; 
If we want to select the first span element within its parent, whether or not it is the first child, we use: span:first-of-type {}
HTML:
<div>
  <p>This is a beginning paragraph</p>
  <span>Span 1</span>
  <span>Span 2</span>
  <span>Span 3</span>
  <p>This is an ending paragraph</p>
</div>

CSS:
span {
  padding: 5px 8px;
  background-color: lightgray;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
span:first-of-type {
  background-color: orange;
}

11) Similarly, for last-of-type!

CSS:
span {
  padding: 5px 8px;
  background-color: lightgray;
  border-radius: 3px;
}
span:last-of-type {
  background-color: orange;
}

12) Not() Pseudo Class:
a) :not() pseudo-clas is a negation selector that selects those elements that do NOT meet a specific condition.
HTML:
<h1>Websites you Might Use Today</h1>
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
<a href="https://courses.bigbinaryacademy.com/">BigBinary Academy</a>
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>
<p>We know more, but these are some you might end up using today.</p>

CSS:
:not(a) {
  color: maroon;
}
/*All the elements that doesn't have link are marked maroon!*/

b) We can combine :not() with other selectors too!
HTML:
<div class="container">
  <h1>üç¶ Ice Cream Delights üç®</h1>
  <p>Explore our delicious range of ice creams!</p>
  <ul class="item-list">
    <li class="item available">üçì Strawberry Sensation</li>
    <li class="item">üçç Pineapple Paradise</li>
    <li class="item available">üçâ Watermelon Wonder</li>
    <li class="item">üçá Grape Delight</li>
    <li class="item">üçä Orange Cream</li>
    <li class="item">üç´ Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough</li>
    <li class="item available">üç¶ Vanilla Dream</li>
    <li class="item">üç™ Cookies and Cream</li>
    <li class="item">üçØ Honeycomb Crunch</li>
    <li class="item">üå∞ Nutty Hazelnut</li>
  </ul>
</div>

CSS:
.container {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 20px;
    color: #333;
}
.item-list {
    list-style-type: none;
}
.item {
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
.item:not(.available) {
    background-color: #ffcccb;
    text-decoration: line-through;
}

/*Items that are not available are being marked: line-through, giving background-color pink:*/
