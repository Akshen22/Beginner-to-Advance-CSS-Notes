1) The heading elements - h1 to h6, header, footer, section and form, div and p elements have their default display set to block.
And so they always start on a new line and stretch to completely fit in the available width. 
Block elements start on a new line, occupy 100% of width by default, and can have height, and width properties, and also have functional margins on all four sides.

But elements like span and a do not create a new line and only take up as much space as needed.
This behavior is set by the element's display property.

We can make elements like span, a, and img behave like block-level elements by setting their display property to block:
p {
  background-color: yellow;
  margin-top: 30px;
}
span, a {
  display: block;
  background-color: orange;
  margin-top: 30px;
}
