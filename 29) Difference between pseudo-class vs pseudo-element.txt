* Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements are both used in CSS to apply specific styles, but they serve different purposes. 

Here’s a breakdown:
1) Pseudo-classes (`:`):
- Definition: Pseudo-classes are used to define the state of an element. 
They target elements based on their state, position, or other factors that are not related to the content structure (e.g., hovering over a link).
- Syntax: Starts with a colon (`:`).
  
Example pseudo-classes:
- :hover: Styles an element when it’s being hovered over.
- :focus: Styles an element when it’s focused (e.g., clicked or tabbed into).
- :nth-child(): Targets specific elements based on their position in a parent.

css
a:hover {
  color: red; /* Changes link color when hovered */
}

input:focus {
  border-color: blue; /* Changes border color when input is focused */
}
```

2) Pseudo-elements (`::`):
- Definition: Pseudo-elements are used to style specific parts of an element, 
such as the first letter or line, or to insert content before or after the actual content of an element.
- Syntax: Starts with two colons (`::`).

Example pseudo-elements:
- ::before: Inserts content before an element.
- ::after: Inserts content after an element.
- ::first-letter: Targets the first letter of an element.
- ::first-line: Targets the first line of an element.

css
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 2em; /* Enlarges the first letter of a paragraph */
}

p::before {
  content: "Note: "; /* Inserts content before the paragraph */
}
```

3) Key Differences:
- Pseudo-class applies to an entire element based on its state or position.
- Pseudo-element applies to specific parts of an element or adds content without altering the actual DOM.
