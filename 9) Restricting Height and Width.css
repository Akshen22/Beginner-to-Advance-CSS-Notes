1) Maximum Height:
a) The max-height property in CSS is used to set the maximum height of an element, allowing us to restrict how tall the element can grow.
b) If the content inside the element is smaller than the value of max-height, the max-height property has no effect. 
In this case, the element's height is calculated based on its content.
c) If the content exceeds the max-height value, the excess content overflows, and the element's height will be limited by the specified max-height.
