1) Maximum Height:
a) The max-height property in CSS is used to set the maximum height of an element, allowing us to restrict how tall the element can grow.
b) If the content inside the element is smaller than the value of max-height, the max-height property has no effect. 
In this case, the element's height is calculated based on its content.
c) If the content exceeds the max-height value, the excess content overflows, and the element's height will be limited by the specified max-height.

2) Maximum Width:
a) The max-width property in CSS is used to set the maximum width of an element, restricting how wide it can become. This ensures that the element does not become too wide.
b) If the element's width is smaller than the value of max-width, the max-width property has no effect, and the element's width remains based on its assigned width.
c) If max-width is smaller than width, the max-width value takes precedence and restricts the width of the element, even if the width property suggests a larger width for the element.
