1) Flex Shrink:
When the flex items don't wrap, they try to shrink as much as possible to fit into the available space.
Using the flex-shrink property, we can control how much each item shrinks. The value can be any number. If the value is 0, the item does not shrink.
The higher the value, the more the item shrinks!

.container {
  display: flex;
}
.container > div {
  padding: 30px;
  margin: 10px;
  width: 33%;
  background-color: orange;
}
.shrink {
  flex-shrink: 2;
}
.shrink-more {
  flex-shrink: 5;
}

2) Flex Basis: (similar to weight)
With flex-grow and flex-shrink, we saw that we can control how much each flex item grows or shrinks.
With the flex-basis property, we can set the initial size of the item. It's possible to set this with the width property too, but flex-basis is a better way to do the same, for flex items. 
The default value is auto. Values can be specified in relative or absolute units:

.container {
  display: flex;
}
.container > div {
  padding: 30px;
  margin: 10px;
  background-color: orange;
}
#one {
  flex-basis: 50px;
}
#two {
  flex-basis: 50%;
}
#three {
  flex-basis: 50%;
}
