1) Overview:
When we want to apply styles to a part of an element like the first letter or first line of a paragraph, or add some content before or after an element using CSS, without actually adding a new element in HTML, 
we can use pseudo-elements like:- ::first-line, ::first-letter, ::before and ::after.

Example:
HTML:
<p id="intro">
  Dale Carnegie was an American writer and lecturer, and the developer of courses in self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking, and interpersonal skills.
</p>
<h2>Famous Quote:</h2>
<p id="quote">
  Remember, today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.
</p>

CSS:
p {
  font-size: 1.1rem;
}
#intro::first-letter {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  color: purple;
}

#quote::before {
  content: 'â€œ';
  font-size: 2rem;
  color: purple;
}
